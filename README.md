# 2D video game project
Simple 2D side scrolling video game for my college project class!

*The learning folder simply contains the code necessary to create the widgets necessary to start game design in raw java code. * 

The code uploaded to this repository is for the most part, controller scripts to make in world interactions possible! All code can be used with unity game and attached to a character object to give the object basic and necessary properties to that 2D object. 

This project helped me to learn some basic C# syntax, it also greatly helped to solidify OOP concepts for me, since objects in a sense came to life in Unity. Using code, we could change any property imaginable for any entity within the game engine. I also would say that I can now comfortably design basic 2D games using the unity game engine.
