# 2D video game project
Simple 2D side scrolling video game for my college project class!

*The learning folder simply contains the code necessary to create the widgets necessary to start game design in raw java code.* 

The code uploaded to this repository are for the most part, controller scripts to make interactions possible! All code can be used with unity game and attached to a character object to give basic and necessary properties to that 2D character object in Unity. 

This project helped me to learn some basic C# syntax, it also greatly helped to solidy OOP concepts since objects in a sense came to life in Unity. Using code we could change any property imaginable within the game engine. I also would say that I am now comfortable designing basic 2D games using the unity game engine. 


*** All code was originally written by Alvin Roe. This was a learning project.
